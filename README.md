# Crowdfunding ETL Project - Group 4

## Overview

This project showcases the development of an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline for crowdfunding data. Utilising Python, Pandas, and SQL, we extracted data from Excel files, transformed it using Python dictionary methods and regular expressions, and finally loaded the processed data into a PostgreSQL database. This README outlines the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidance.

## Project Structure

-   `ETL_Mini_Project_Group4.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the ETL pipeline.
-   `crowdfunding_db_schema.sql`: SQL schema file for creating the database tables.
-   `Resources/`: Folder containing the original Excel data files and exported CSV files:
    -   `crowdfunding.xlsx`: Crowdfunding campaign data.
    -   `contacts.xlsx`: Contact information for the campaigns.
    -   `category.csv`: Categories of crowdfunding campaigns.
    -   `subcategory.csv`: Subcategories of crowdfunding campaigns.
    -   `campaign.csv`: Details of crowdfunding campaigns.
    -   `contacts.csv`: Contact information extracted and transformed.
-   `Images/`: Folder containing screenshots of:
    -   `campaign dataframe`: images of csv export and dataframe.
    -   `category dataframe`: images of csv export and dataframe.
    -   `contacts dataframe`: images of csv export and dataframe.
    -   `crowdfunding database` images of ERD, tables, imported data. 
    -   `subcategory dataframe`: images of csv export and dataframe.

## Before You Begin

-   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.
-   Install PostgreSQL and create a new database named `crowdfunding_db`.
-   Install the required Python libraries: Pandas for data manipulation and psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy for database interaction.


`pip install pandas psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy`

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the cloned directory.
3.  Ensure the `Resources` folder contains the `crowdfunding.xlsx` and `contacts.xlsx` files.
4.  Open the `ETL_Mini_Project_Group4.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
5.  Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the ETL pipeline.

## Database Setup

1.  Open the `crowdfunding_db_schema.sql` file with a text editor or an SQL client.
2.  Execute the SQL commands within the file to create the necessary tables in your `crowdfunding_db` database.
3.  Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to load data into the database.

## Using the Project

-   The Jupyter Notebook is divided into sections corresponding to each step of the ETL process:
    -   **Extract**: Reading data from the Excel files.
    -   **Transform**: Cleaning and structuring the data into a suitable format.
    -   **Load**: Inserting the data into the PostgreSQL database.
-   Execute each cell in the notebook to perform the ETL operations.
-   The notebook includes comments and instructions to guide you through the process.
